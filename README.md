# Soil Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project aims to observe and analyze the differences in soil qualities at two distinct transects. It is based on my previous A-level geography project, where data was collected along transects in different regions. The primary focus is on understanding how soil characteristics vary in relation to factors such as slope, elevation, and other environmental parameters.

## Data Overview

### Bangor Transect (Bangor-data)

*Description of the data from the Bangor transect goes here.*

### Peris Transect (Peris-data)

*Description of the data from the Peris transect goes here.*

## Analysis

*Describe the analysis performed on the data, including any pre-processing steps, univariate analysis, and bivariate analysis.*

## Findings

*Summarize the key findings from the analysis. Highlight any notable trends, correlations, or patterns observed in the data.*

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, it was observed that pH levels tend to have an inverse relationship with water content in general. This insight provides valuable information about the soil characteristics at both transects and may have implications for understanding the local ecosystems.
